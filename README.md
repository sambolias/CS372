I decided to just add all my CS372 extra work to this repo.
Seems like the perfect for the kata assignment
I also am slightly OCD and wrote a further abstraction to the 
roman numerals program we did in class so I'm adding that as well.
I need more practice with the katas, my code isn't exactly clear



So imagine this is a old version I needed to recover and make master

I made branch using git branch revertfiles


The true test is can I save this to origin master...I'm pretty sure i could merge it

in revertfiles branch i checked version number i needed to recover using git log

git diff [vrsn] can tell you the differences in files

then I used git checkout -b [vrsn] to open old version, which now i pretend update with this description
